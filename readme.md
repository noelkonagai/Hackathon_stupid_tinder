## Concept

This project was created as part of NYU Shanghai's first annual [Stupid Hackathon](https://stupidhackathonsh.github.io/). The purpose of Stupid Hackathon is to create products that are useless, meaningless, or terrible in their idea. Our team of two created Stupid Tinder, that is supposed to satirize the original Tinder application by creating profiles that aren't humans. In this application you can match with animals, creatures, and objects, because, seriously, dating humans is always troublesome. The project was created in six hours.

## Execution

Given the time constraints, our team used a Bootstrap of [UI Pasta](http://www.uipasta.com) that contained a sliding Carousel. This Carousel was used as our mock-up of the Tinder-style deck of profiles. After the Swiping section, a "Matches" section appears where each of the matches can be seen.

## Matching Algorithm

The demo of our web application went like this. "We hired some of the best data scientists in the world that maximize your user experience by letting you match with up to 50% of the profiles! (Noel whispers to Sara) Don't tell them that we just used a random number generator." The clever variable that takes into account all the research done on quantifying love is below:

'''
var binary = Math.floor((Math.random() * 100) + 1);
